/// Forward function application.
///
/// Applies the function on the right to the value on the left. Functions of >1 argument can be applied by placing their arguments in a tuple on the left hand side.
///
/// This is a useful way of clarifying the flow of data through a series of functions. For example, you can use this to count the base-10 digits of an integer:
///
///		let digits = 100 |> toString |> count // => 3

/// Applies the function on the right to the value on the left, but for functions that use the value for side effects instead of transforming it.
///
/// This can be a nice way to strap side effects to an expression without having to drop into an imperative style, such as adding configuration to an objects initialization:
///
///		lazy var formatter = NSDateFormatter() |> { $0.timeStyle = .FullStyle }
